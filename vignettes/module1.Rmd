`sus346` is the package I am developing for the coursework component of GEOG346 (Geo-Spatial Analysis with R).

I currently has one function, `my_multiplier`, which is executed as follows:
```{r setup}
library(sus346)
my_multiplier(2)
my_multiplier(6)
my_multiplier(12)
```

I will be adding others, and updating this vignette as we go.
